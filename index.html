                <h2>About this page</h2>
                <p>Welcome to my homepage.<br><br>This website is a personal project of mine for a coding course.<br>I have tried to vary the content to cater for various interests. This homepage will blog and cover my time in <span class="emphasis">Japan</span> at the beginning of 2020.<br><br>
                It was a dream of mine to visit Japan for a long time, I have enjoyed anime since being a young teenager and developed a greater interest in the culture, values and etiquette as I grew older.<br><br>
                Fortunately my boyfriend <img src="image/meachris.JPG" class="floatrightthumb" alt="Picture of Daniel with his boyfriend in Nara, Japan"> <span class="code-snip">(pictured with me right)</span> had visited Japan twice before. He organised a holiday there with me which was an absolutely fantastic experience.<br><br>When setting out to travel there it was the second time I would head to the Asian continent and I needed to learn about the etiquette to not offend or disrespect the place I was visiting, a seemingly obvious endeavour but one that ended up with many complex cultural differences that needed remembering.</p>

                    <h3>Etiquette basics</h3>
                    <p>So what kind of etiquette do you need to remember?<br><br>
                    If you buy food or drink from a <span class="highlight">vending machine</span> don't walk around while eating/drinking - stop beside it, consume your purchase & place it into the provided bin.<br><br>
                    If you are on a <span class="highlight">train or subway</span>, mute and do not talk on your phone.<br><br>
                    If you have <span class="highlight">tattoos</span> (I do), you cannot usually visit an onsen - tattoos are still associated with the Yakuza.<br><br>
                    If you are <span class="highlight">vegetarian</span> you must carefully word how you state this.</p>

                    <h2>Tokyo</h2>
                    <p>The first place in Japan we visited was Tokyo, a vast city with various quarters.<br><br>No matter where you went there was something for everyone. Despite the vast population and business I've never seen cleaner streets anywhere.<br><br>There multi-story shopping centres with floors upon floors of products (<span class="highlight">usually with a restaurant on top</span>), hidden shrines in the middle of the metropolis and neon lights illuminating the way.<br><br>I felt safer here than any other major city I've visited in the world.<br><br>The abundance of shopping centres meant that you could be walking out of the subway and the stairs would lead you directly into a shopping centre.</p>

                    <h2>Takayama</h2>
                    <p>Takayama was the first "<snip class="emphasis">traditional</snip>" town we visited. It was a world-apart from Tokyo, with more antiquated architecture and a strong sense of historical preservation.<br><br>The streets were serene, the air extremely fresh and paths lead into the woods (<span class="highlight">warning signs of wild bears included</span>) it really was the majestic and stereotypical Japan you'd expect from a samurai film.<br><br>This was also despite it being January, one of the only places we encountered snow. We also stayed in a <span class="emphasis">ryokan</span>, the traditional-style Japanese hotel, rather than a westernised one.<br><br>I was naive enough to opt for the traditional breakfast rather than the western continental.</p>

                    <h2>Shirikawa-Go</h2>
                    <p>This was the part of the trip I was most looking forward to not only was it a <span class="emphasis">world heritage</span> site, but it was also nested in snowy mountains.<br><br>It was wonderful to look around and also see a different cultures version of a thatched roof, despite being a world-apart from England similar historic techniques had been used to build houses.<br><br>I also, unlike in the ryokan had another traditional meal, this time absolutely delicious.</p>

                    <h2>Kanazawa</h2>
                    <p>Kanazawa was a return to a city, albeit a much smaller city than Tokyo and one I would argue felt more serene.<br><br>Of particular note was a <span class="emphasis">water fountain that was a clock</span> and as I would expect of Japan construction cones that were shaped like bears.<br><br>The shopping centres here were not as vast, but I did a lot of clothes shopping with much encouragement from my boyfriend.</p>

                    <h2>Kyoto</h2>
                    <p>The historic Kyoto was originally the capital of Japan, and unlike Tokyo was far more of a fusion of traditional and modern architecture.<br><br>I don't have a whole lot to say about Kyoto as we only spent a day here, much of it was spent trying to figure out how to meet our tour guide who was to take us to Nara.</p>

                    <h2>Nara</h2>
                    <p>Nara was <snip class="emphasis">hamazing</snip>! Upon our travel here we met with the "<span class="emphasis">domesticated deer</span>" who not only waited at zebra crossings with pedestrians, but also bowed politely back at you when you bowed.<br><br>There were rather amusing warning signs that they were still wild animals, but I'd never seen anything quite as amusing as their mannerisms.<br><br>We spent the day travelling through Nara park reaching a temple with gold Buddha statues.<br><br>Our guide <span class="emphasis">Takako</span> was extremely polite and well spoken, giving us time to stop and take pictures and even taking the picture featured at the top of this page.</p>

                    <h2>Osaka</h2>
                    <p>Osaka is affectionately refered to as the <span class="emphasis">Manchester of Japan</span>, I can truly see why; the people were warmer and less shy to conversation with foreigners, the districts had the same vibe and the attitude of shopkeepers was vastly more chatty.<br><br>It was a great city to end the trip on and had beautiful walks despite being busy.</p>

            <h3 class="sticky-headerfloat">Thinking to visit?</h3>
            <article class="solo">
                <p>If you are thinking of visiting Japan: <span class="emphasis">DO IT</span>! I really can't recommend the experience enough, particularly if you've only previously visited western cultures. It's interesting culturally, historically and with a strong relevance in modern times, particularly in consumer electronics (<span class="highlight">although not to the futuristic cliche that the west imparts it</span>). It really is a fantastic place to experience.
                <br><br>
                There's plenty about the trip that I haven't mentioned here, I would much encourage exploration and proper planning - see what you want to see, not the "main attractions".</p>
