                <p>Beginning this week I didn't know how to code whatsoever, I was familiar with some of the concepts and terms and had a very rudimentary knowledge of HTML from peeking at source code of websites. I even owned books on <span class="highlight">HTML, CSS and jQuery</span>, but I was never encouraged to work quietly in a room and learn alone in this way.<br><br>I saw <span class="emphasis">Code Nation</span> advertised and I knew immediately this was something that I wanted to pursue, the interest was there - just not the learning method.<br><br>Learning with people and having demonstrations of the basic concepts really helps me understand what can be done and what possibilities exist.<br><br>When we started the course we were presented with the code <span class="code-snip">for i in range(10):</span> which of course was completely foreign.<br><br>For the week I learned Python my knowledge expanded to a point where I was confident enough to write code, think of solutions and pursue ideas with a try and reassess if it didn't work attitude.<br><br>I have had so much fun learning it, particularly the free-reign second week where we were tasked to <span class="emphasis">build a game</span>.<br><br>Not only was the learning experience fantastic, I've learned key insights and a passion for making things with code, but also probably most importantly <span class="emphasis">the people</span>. I really believe that bouncing ideas and code snippets around has had a huge impact and increased the overall enjoyment of the course and coding.<br><br>I would love to pursue a career in it, I think working collaboratively on code in this manner is excellent and I would encourage anyone who wants to learn code: <span class="emphasis">try</span>!</p>

                    <p>At a glance HTML & CSS seemed simple when compared to Python. This was my error. Although the languages are easier to understand, working with them in practice is not as straightforward as you have a visual representation to work with and tweak. Small changes can become complex problem solving practices.<br><br>We learned the basics of these languages at the beginning of the third week. By the end of it we needed a functional website (<span class="highlight">which you are now viewing</span>), a daunting task indeed. One that required extra research and a lot of trial and error.<br><br>I had originally written the CSS with a thought processes that was too logical, I ended up <span class="emphasis">reworking it</span> and starting the CSS from scratch with a structure in my head of how to lay it out. I am happier with the result, but I also know that with practice I can get better at this.<br><br>Overall I have enjoyed learning HTML and CSS, as with Python I would recommend at least trying to learn the basics. What's the worst that can happen?<br><br>I am truly grateful for the three weeks of learning that I have had, particularly of <span class="emphasis">Keira @ Code Nation</span> who has made this a phenomenal experience.</p>
